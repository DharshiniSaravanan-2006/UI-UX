ðŸš€ Leveling Up in UI/UX Design! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

After my UI/UX internship, I took another step forward by attending a two-day UI/UX workshop to deepen my understanding of design principles. The workshop covered key aspects like:

âœ” Define
âœ” Research
âœ” Analyze & Plan
âœ” Design & Prototype
âœ” Testing & Launch
âœ” Iteration & Improvement

I also learned how to use File menus, toolboxes, properties, and prototyping tools effectively. ðŸŽ¯

As a hands-on project, I created a Quiz App, applying these concepts in real-time! This experience has strengthened my skills and fueled my passion for UI/UX design.

Excited to keep learning and growing in this field! ðŸš€
